# Phonebook

# General Description

The Phone Book application is a simple Java Swing-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to manage a list of contacts. The program enables users to add, delete, search, display, and sort contacts by name. It validates input data to ensure phone numbers consist only of digits and are 10 digits long. The application also prevents duplicate entries for contacts with the same name.
